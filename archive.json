So finally the Attester can send the raw public key, and the Attestation Result to the Relying Party, while the hash of raw public key is inside the signed Attestation Result.\r\n\r\nSo there are two possible options\r\n\r\n1. Raw Public key/Cerificate\r\n2. hash(raw public key/certificate)\r\n\r\nalso, in the option two, when the raw pub key/certificate remains unchanged for the reconnection with the relying party, there is even no need to send the raw public/key from attester to the relying party, as long as the relying party has a cache of the raw public key as it can compare the hash inside the attestation result with the hash of raw public key in its local data set.",

This ensures that the attestation evidence cannot be diverted and used by an attacker to impersonate the prover in a different context. \r\n    Diversion Attack:  A man-in-the-middle attack where an adversary intercepts and forwards attestation messages to trick a verifier into believing that the adversary's session is authenticated. The attacker's goal is to divert the authentication result and the subsequent privileged information (e.g., keys) to itself. Key Binding is the primary defense against this attack.\r\n",
