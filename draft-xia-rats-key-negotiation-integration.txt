1.  Introduction

   Remote attestation is a security mechanism based on trusted hardware
   (e.g., TPM, TEE), allowing remote verifiers to cryptographically
   verify the integrity of the target device's software configuration,
   hardware state, and runtime environment.  Hence, remote attestation
   can effectively prove the overall security state of the endpoint.
   Secure channel protocols (e.g., TLS, QUIC, IPSec, SSH) establish end-
   to-end (E2E) secure channels based on the authentication of the
   endpoint's legitimate identity and secure key negotiation, ensuring
   the security of network communication.  By organically combining
   remote attestation protocols with secure channel protocols and
   establishing cryptographic binding between them, it is possible to
   achieve a logical binding of endpoint security and network security,
   ensuring dual verification and protection of the identity and state
   of the endpoint in secure connections.  Attested TLS
   [I-D.fossati-tls-attestation] [I-D.fossati-tls-exported-attestation]
   is currently an important related work in the industry, and other
   similar works include binding remote attestation with credential
   issuance (e.g., certificates [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation], OAuth
   tokens, etc.) to achieve security enhancement.

   However, in some scenarios, the above binding may not be possible.
   For example:

   *  Scenario 1: When tenants in a public cloud/compute cluster deploy
      workloads, they need to first verify their runtime environment's
      security through remote attestation before requesting Key
      Management Service (KMS) to assign application-layer data keys to
      the Virtual Machine (VM)/compute node where the workload resides.
      At this point, these keys are used for application-layer data
      encryption, such as file encryption or disk encryption, and are
      not used for any secure channel protocols.  For example, to
      protect model parameters from leakage and tampering, model weights
      and other parameters need to be encrypted before model loading and
      transmitted to a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).  At this
      time, it is necessary to ensure that only the TEE has the key and
      decrypts it.

   *  Scenario 2: The end user/client accesses the online TEE computing
      environment, submits his data for business processing or large
      model inference, and needs to ensure the security of the entire
      computing environment through remote attestation before
      establishing a secure connection.  At this point, there are
      multiple options for the secure channel protocol that can be
      established, such as TLS, IPSec, QUIC, OHTTP, etc.  The user may
      only need to complete E2E key negotiation based on remote
      attestation.  As for which secure protocol or application layer
      encryption the negotiated key is used for, and how it is used,
      there can be various implementation methods.

   In summary, considering the diversity of remote attestation
   application scenarios and the limitations or complexity of combining
   with security protocols, this draft proposes a lightweight security
   enhancement scheme based on remote attestation—key negotiation
   integrated into remote attestation.  By organically integrating the
   key steps of E2E key negotiation into the remote attestation process,
   the following can be achieved:

   *  The key distribution of KMS or E2E key negotiation can be
      automatically completed based on remote attestation, improving the
      security of key negotiation;

   *  The keys negotiated automatically can be flexibly applied in
      various ways, whether for secure protocols or application layer
      encryption;

   *  Compared to the complete and systematic implementation of Attested
      TLS, a more lightweight implementation can be provided.

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Integration Scheme

   The current specification is based on passport model of RATS.  Future
   versions of specification will include the background-check model.
   We present two integration schemes:

2.1.  Key Distribution Based on KMS Integrated with Remote Attestation

   The KMS mechanism on public cloud networks includes the root of
   trust, secure channels between Attester and KMS, full lifecycle
   management of keys (including key generation, storage, rotation, and
   destruction), hierarchical encryption architecture (such as Envelope
   Encryption), and access control mechanisms.  There are two cases
   here:

   *  Attester generates keys to be distributed to other applications
      via KMS.

   *  Attester obtains keys from the KMS.

   So KMS enables applications to generate/obtain their own application-
   layer encryption symmetric/asymmetric keys and distribute these keys
   between the required applications.  Furthermore, the method of
   integrating key distribution into the remote attestation interaction
   process is shown in the following diagram:

        .------------.
        |            | 2. Compare Evidence
        |  Verifier  | against appraisal policy
        |            |
        '--------+---'
            ^    |
1. Evidence |    | 3. Attestation
            |    | Result
            |    v
        .---+--------.                .-------------.
        |            +--------------->|   Relying   | 5. Compare Attestation
        |  Attester  |4. Attestation  |    Party    | Result against
        |            |   Result       |    & KMS    | appraisal policy
        '------------' + SK/ASK/ESK   '-------------' + Distribute Keys

SK：Symmetric Key
ASK：Asymmetric Key
ESK：Encrypted Symmetric Key

    Figure 1: Key Distribution Based on KMS Integrated with Remote
                             Attestation

   In the standard remote attestation process described above, the
   Attester can generate and provide/request the Attester's application
   layer SK/ASK/ESK keys in the result returned to the KMS.  SK MUST be
   conveyed over a secure channel.  The KMS can generate or distribute
   these keys accordingly.  During key rotation, the KMS can proactively
   trigger the above process to complete the update and rotation of the
   new and old keys.

2.2.  Integrating E2E Key Negotiation Into Remote Attestation

   The current main implementation mechanism for E2E key negotiation is
   DHE and ECDHE.  Taking ECDHE as an example, the method of integrating
   it into remote attestation is shown in the following figure:

       .------------.
       |            | 4. Compare Evidence
       |  Verifier  | against appraisal policy
       |            |
       '--------+---'
           ^    |
3 Evidence |    | 5. Attestation
           |    | Result
           |    v     1. Attestation
      .---+--------. Request + pubC.-------------.
      |  Attester  <-------------->|   Relying   | 7. Compare Attestation
      |  & Server  | 6.Attestation |    Party    | Result against
      |            | Result        |    & Client | appraisal policy
      '------------' + pubS        '-------------' + SK = privC * pubS
    2. SK = privS * pubC

SK：Symmetric Key
(privC,pubC): Client's ECDHE key pair
(privS,pubS): Server's ECDHE key pair

  Figure 2: Integrating E2E Key Negotiation Into Remote Attestation

   In the standard remote attestation process described above, the
   Client includes the public key pubC from its dynamically generated
   ECDHE key pair (privC, pubC) in the remote attestation request
   message, while retaining its private key privC.  Upon receiving pubC,
   the Server can compute the symmetric key SK using its private key
   privS from its dynamically generated ECDHE key pair (privS, pubS).
   After completing the remote attestation with the Verifier, the Server
   includes its pubS in the Attestation Result returned to the Client.
   Once the Client verifies the Attestation Result, it can compute the
   symmetric key SK using pubS and its own private key privC, thereby
   completing both the remote attestation and ECDHE key agreement.

3.  Use of Negotiated Keys in Different Security Protocols

   Through the above process, key negotiation/distribution is completed
   during the remote attestation process, and is synchronized based on
   the results of the remote attestation.  If the negotiated key is used
   for application layer encryption, its specific usage is strongly
   related to the application and can be very flexible.  When the key is
   used for the security protocols, such as TLS, IPSec, etc., there are
   at least the following binding methods:

   *  TLS: The negotiated key can be used as a pre-shared key for
      subsequent TLS handshakes; the key can also be used as an
      externally imported shared key to participate in TLS Hybrid key
      exchange [I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design];

   *  IPSec: The negotiated key can be used as a pre-shared key for
      subsequent IKEv2 handshakes; or the key can be directly used as a
      session key for data plane encryption and integrity protection in
      IPSec ESP; or the key can also be used as Post-quantum Preshared
      Keys (PPKs) [RFC8784] to achieve binding with the IPSec protocol.

4.  Remote Attestation Protocol and Message Extensions

   This section describes how to extend RATS protocol and message to
   incorporate key negotiation into the remote attestation process.
